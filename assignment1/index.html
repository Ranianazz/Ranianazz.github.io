        <h4>The first thing I paid attention to when interacting with luni</h4>
        <p class="lato-font">
          As soon as the creative studio came into view, I moved my mouse around
          to observe how the rooms shifted in response. Next, I clicked on
          "Omada," which appeared to be a game room. Indeed, it was a 3D,
          cartoonish sports environment. I hovered over a car racing on the
          tracks, but when I clicked on it, nothing happened. Then, I clicked on
          a soccer ball and earned coins for scoring goals; however, I wasn't
          able to get the basketball in the hoop when I clicked on it. Finally,
          I clicked on "Discover Omada." Omada is a sports app; it's a social
          game that focuses on sports betting without involving real money.

        <h4>What I enaged with the most</h4>
        <p>
          I spent most of my time interested in the studio page, reading about
          the Luni adventure. The article was laid out in an interesting and
          creative manner, luring me in to find out more about their story and
          their app. It introduced the team and explained how they got started,
          which was inspiring, as they began as just four people experimenting
          with Unity. This inspires me as a digital design student; with the
          right mindset, I could potentially develop an app that cool.

        <h4>The most common action</h4>
        <p>
          The most prominent feature in luni is the delightful jiggle
          interaction that occurs when you hover over each room. As your cursor
          glides over the pastel, animated icons representing different spaces,
          each room responds with a playful little jiggle that captures your
          attention. This charming and engaging effect piqued my curiosity,
          inviting me to explore further and discover all the intriguing
          offerings and content available on their website.
        </p>
        <h4>My immprssion of the website</h4>
        <p>
          The website aims to promote the Omada app, an engaging sports betting
          platform that operates without real money, allowing users to win
          branded sportswear instead. It also highlights the team's commitment
          to fostering creativity while supporting millions of brands. The
          organization is keen on welcoming new members to further enhance this
          creative endeavor.
        </p>
        <h4>how luni comunicates their goals</h4>
        <p>
          Luni’s interactive 3D animations effectively communicate their goal of
          making design creative and enjoyable by creating an engaging
          experience. Their playful theme and pastel animations instantly
          display their friendly brand identity, while dynamic elements like
          bouncing rooms and scroll-triggered transitions demonstrate the app’s
          ease of use without relying on text. These interactive features
          connects with us emotionaly reinforce Luni’s mission, making a
          potentially complex process into a fun, approachable experience for
          everyone.
        </p>
        <h4>How the interaction should be</h4>
        <p>
          Luni is designed for frequent, short interactions that are ideal for
          quick, daily or weekly sessions (5–15 minutes) to create designs
          efficiently, its playful 3D elements and AI tools encourage long-term
          engagement by making the process enjoyable. I belive the app should be
          used occasionally to explore updates. The experience stays creative,
          making it sustainable for months or longer for design needs.
        </p>
        <h4>
          How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Luni’s interactive designs use playful animations to train users
          organically. You naturally settle into a rhythm daily or weekly use
          feels limitless with smart workflows and templates, while creative
          experimentation unfolds over months through evolving content and
          community inspiration. It’s design made effortless at first, then
          endlessly rewarding as your skills grow.
