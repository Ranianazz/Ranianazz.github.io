        1 What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </h3>
      <p class="lato-font">
        The first thing I noticed was the colour scheme on the screen. The
        website's creators used soft tones, including shades of blue and violet,
        and there was a number 2 displayed in the bottom right corner. At first,
        I wondered why the number 2 was there and noticed that nothing seemed to
        be happening. However, I soon realized that it was actually a loading
        icon. This icon eventually revealed a 3D simulation of what appeared to
        be the creator's studio.

      <p class="lato-font">
        Once the creative studio was visible, I hovered the mouse around to see
        the rooms move around with the mouse. Next, I clicked on Omada, which
        looked like a game room. Indeed, it was a 3D cartoonish sports room. I
        hovered over the car racing on the tracks, then clicked on it, and
        nothing happened. I clicked on the soccer ball and got coins for getting
        it in the goals. I clicked on the basketball and failed to get it in the
        hoop. I clicked on Discover Omada. Omada is a sports app; it's a social
        game that focuses on sports betting.
