        <h4>The first thing I paid attention to when interacting with luni</h4>
        <p class="lato-font">
          The visuals instantly captivated my attention with their dreamy pastel
          hues—soft blush pinks, soft yellow, and dreamy lavenders—blending like
          a watercolour cotton candy, while playful 3D rooms floated through the
          scene, each one bouncing with a lively little jiggle that made them
          feel alive, as if they might giggle or float away the moment I looked
          too closely, weaving a whismsical digital world that is inviting and
          engaging.
        </p>
        <h4>The 2 mintute interating with luni</h4>
        <p class="lato-font">
          Once the creative studio came into view, I moved my mouse around to
          watch the rooms swayed in response. as I moves my curser around the
          screen Omada peeked my interest. I clicked on Omada, a dreamy game
          room apeared. Indeed, it was a 3D sports environment. I hovered over a
          car racing on the tracks, but when I clicked on it, nothing happened.
          I then clicked on a soccer ball several times and earned coins for
          scoring goals. However, I didn't manage to get the basketball in the
          hoop when I clicked on it. Finally, I clicked on "Discover Omada."
          Omada is a sports app; it's a social game that focuses on sports
          betting without involving real money.

        <h4>What I enaged with the most</h4>
        <p>
          I found myself obsorbed in the studio room, reading about the Luni
          adventure. The article layout no longer had the pastel colours and no
          3d rooms it was just an article with some photos on the sides and big
          headings.dispite this I still wanted to find out more about luni so I
          read the artical which introduce the team and explained how they got
          started, which was inspiring, as they began as just four people
          experimenting with Unity. This inspires me as a digital design
          student; with the right mindset, I could potentially develop an app
          that cool.
        </p>
        <div id="I"><img src="luni-studio.png" /></div>
        <h4>The most common action</h4>
        <p>
          The most prominent feature in luni is the delightful jiggle
          interaction that occurs when you hover over each room. As your cursor
          glides over the pastel, animated icons representing different spaces,
          each room responds with a playful little jiggle that captures your
          attention. This charming and engaging effect piqued my curiosity,
          inviting me to explore further and discover all the intriguing
          offerings and content available on their website.
        </p>
        <h4>My immprssion of the website</h4>
        <p>
          The website aims to promote the Omada app, an engaging sports betting
          platform that operates without real money, allowing users to win
          branded sportswear instead. It also highlights the team's commitment
          to fostering creativity while supporting millions of brands. The
          organization is keen on welcoming new members to further enhance this
          creative endeavor.
        </p>
        <h4>how luni comunicates their goals</h4>
        <p>
          Luni’s interactive 3D animations effectively communicate their goal of
          making design creative and enjoyable by creating an engaging
          experience. Their playful theme and pastel animations instantly
          display their friendly brand identity, while dynamic elements like
          bouncing rooms and scroll-triggered transitions demonstrate the app’s
          ease of use without relying on text. These interactive features
          connects with us emotionaly reinforce Luni’s mission, making a
          potentially complex process into a fun, approachable experience for
          everyone.
        </p>
        <h4>How the interaction should be</h4>
        <p>
          Luni is designed for frequent, short interactions that are ideal for
          quick, daily or weekly sessions (5–15 minutes) to create designs
          efficiently, its playful 3D elements and AI tools encourage long-term
          engagement by making the process enjoyable. I belive the app should be
          used occasionally to explore updates. The experience stays creative,
          making it sustainable for months or longer for design needs.
        </p>
        <h4>
          How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Luni’s interactive designs use playful animations to train users
          organically. You naturally settle into a rhythm daily or weekly use
          feels limitless with smart workflows and templates, while creative
          experimentation unfolds over months through evolving content and
          community inspiration. It’s design made effortless at first, then
          endlessly rewarding as your skills grow.
