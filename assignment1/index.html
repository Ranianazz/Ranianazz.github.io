        <h4>
          1. The first thing I paid attention to when interacting with luni
        </h4>
        <p class="lato-font">
          The visuals instantly captivated my attention with their dreamy pastel
          hues soft blush pinks, soft yellow, and dreamy lavenders blending like
          a watercolour cotton candy, while playful 3D rooms floated through the
          scene, each one bouncing with a lively little jiggle that made them
          feel alive, as if they might giggle or float away the moment I looked
          too closely, weaving a whismsical digital world that is inviting and
          engaging.
        </p>
        <h4>2. The 2 mintute interating with luni</h4>
        <p class="lato-font">
          Once the creative studio came into view, I moved my mouse around to
          watch the rooms swayed in response. as I moves my curser around the
          screen Omada peeked my interest. I clicked on Omada, a dreamy game
          room apeared. Indeed, it was a 3D sports environment. I hovered over a
          car racing on the tracks, but when I clicked on it, nothing happened.
          I then clicked on a soccer ball several times and earned coins for
          scoring goals. However, I didn't manage to get the basketball in the
          hoop when I clicked on it. Finally, I clicked on "Discover Omada."
          Omada is a sports app; it's a social game that focuses on sports
          betting without involving real money.
        </p>

        <h4>3. What I enaged with the most</h4>
        <p>
          I found myself obsorbed in the studio room, reading about the Luni
          adventure. The article layout no longer had the pastel colours and no
          3d rooms it was just an article with some photos on the sides and big
          headings.dispite this I still wanted to find out more about luni so I
          read the artical which introduce the team and explained how they got
          started, which was inspiring, as they began as just four people
          experimenting with Unity. This inspires me as a digital design
          student; with the right mindset, I could potentially develop an app
          that cool.

        </div>
        <h4>4. The most common action</h4>
        <p>
          The most prominent feature in luni is the delightful jiggle
          interaction that occurs when you hover over each room. As your cursor
          glides over the pastel, animated icons representing different spaces,
          each room responds with a playful little jiggle that captures your
          attention. This charming and engaging effect piqued my curiosity,
          inviting me to explore further and discover all the intriguing
          offerings and content available on their website.
        </p>
        <h4>5. My immprssion of the website</h4>
        <p>
          The website aims to promote the Omada app, an engaging sports betting
          platform that operates without real money, allowing users to win
          branded sportswear instead. It also highlights the team's commitment
          to fostering creativity while supporting millions of brands. The
          organization is keen on welcoming new members to further enhance this
          creative endeavor.
        </p>
        <h4>6. how luni comunicates their goals</h4>
        <p>
          Luni’s interactive 3D animations effectively communicate their goal of
          making design creative and enjoyable by creating an engaging
          experience. Their playful theme and pastel animations instantly
          display their friendly brand identity, while dynamic elements like
          bouncing rooms and scroll-triggered transitions demonstrate the app’s
          ease of use without relying on text. These interactive features
          connects with us emotionaly reinforce Luni’s mission, making a
          potentially complex process into a fun, approachable experience for
          everyone.
        </p>
        <h4>7. How the interaction should be</h4>
        <p>
          Luni is designed for frequent, short interactions that are ideal for
          quick, daily or weekly sessions (5–15 minutes) to create designs
          efficiently, its playful 3D elements and AI tools encourage long-term
          engagement by making the process enjoyable. I belive the app should be
          used occasionally to explore updates. The experience stays creative,
          making it sustainable for months or longer for design needs.
        </p>
        <h4>
          8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Luni’s interactive designs use playful animations and intuitive
          layouts to encourage natural, consistent use. Their apps—like the
          Running Coach, Nutrition Coach, and other healthy lifestyle tools—are
          designed to support daily habits with ease. With helpful additions
          like a calendar and weather app, users can build routines around their
          goals. Over time, what starts as simple daily use becomes a deeply
          rewarding experience.

        </div>
        <h4>9. Other media forms that luni refreneces</h4>
        <p>
          I love how Luni's site uses these squishy, candy-colored 3D models
          that wobble when you hover over them—the interaction feels just like
          Spline animations. The characters have that blocky Fortnite charm but
          dialed up with extra cuteness, while the interactive 3D rooms spark
          the same magic as Spark Link. Together, they create a world that’s
          playful and immersive.
        </p>
        <h4>10. behaviour expectations</h4>
        <p>
          Luni encourages play through delightful interactive elements designed
          to engage users. Creative buttons and playful animations lure you in,
          creating a sense of belonging because Luni wants you to download their
          apps and become part of their team. The website serves as both an
          invitation to interact and a gateway to discovering their collection
          of apps, making the transition from visitor to community member feel
          natural and exciting.
        </p>
        <h4>11. how I feel when engaging with luni</h4>
        <p>
          Luni encourages play through its charming design soft pastel colours
          and rounded shapes create a friendly, joyful atmosphere that instantly
          lifts your mood. Interacting with Luni feels like stepping into a
          world of cotton candy and carefree fun, where every click brings a
          smile. The playful aesthetic doesn’t just look inviting it makes you
          feel happy, as if you’ve been welcomed into a vibrant, sugar-coated
          daydream.
        </p>
        <h4>12. frastrating part</h4>
        <p>
          Luni's webpage has several non-functional buttons, and their
          interactions lack sound feedback. The purpose of these elements isn't
          immediately clear - it took me considerable time to understand their
          function, and I'm still uncertain whether Luni is an app development
          company or simply promoting a few specific apps. The overall messaging
          about their core business remains unclear.
        </p>
        <div class="tektur-font"><img src="button-error.png" /></div>
        <h4>13. satisfing part</h4>
        <p>
          The adorable aesthetic of Luni's interactive rooms is deeply
          satisfying, their soft pastel colour palette washes the screen in
          calming pinks, blues, and purple, creating a visual sweetness that's
          pleasing to the eye. Each room has a playful interaction, bouncing
          with a jiggle when hovered over, making the simple interaction feel
          unexpectedly joyful. The subtle movement of a soccer ball or basket
          ball paired with the soothing colours transforms every engagement into
          a delightful moment.
        </p>

        <h4>My blogs asthetic desions</h4>
        <p>
          The colour palette was carefully selected to complement Luni’s
          aesthetic, blending soft pink tones with a dark pink-purple border
          that made the visuals pop while harmonizing with Luni’s brand
          identity. The chosen font mirrored Luni’s playful typography, and
          strategically placed images provided additional clarity where
          needed—enhancing understanding without overwhelming the design.
